/* -- Find the Total Sales
SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_sales 
FROM gold.fact_sales;

-- Find how many items are sold
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity 
FROM gold.fact_sales;

-- Find the average selling price
SELECT AVG(price) AS avg_price 
FROM gold. fact_sales;

-- Find the Total number of Orders
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT order_number) AS total_orders  -- Use of DISSTINCT as there are duplicate orders
FROM gold.fact_sales;

-- Find the total number of products
SELECT COUNT (product_name) AS total_products 
FROM gold.dim_products;

-- Find the total number of customers
SELECT COUNT (customer_key) AS total_customers 
FROM gold .dim_customers;

-- Find the total number of customers that has placed an order
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers 
FROM gold.fact_sales;

(All the above codes can run seperately but better will be to run in a single go to get a better understanding)
